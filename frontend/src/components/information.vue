    Soap vs. Hand sanitizer

    Correction. Using hand sanitizer first
    then soap




     What better soap or hand sanitizer. IT says that in general soap is better. This is because they keep the cell completely apart

     you and objects

     soap is better because it also gets rid of dirt that could be hiding

    When on the go use hand sanitizer for a long as possible rubbing it whole hand.

    When using soap and water also cover your whole hand. Do both for about 20 seconds.

    When using hand sanitizer use it until your hand are dry.

    <h3>What happens arfter you have been infected.</h3>
    First day feels like the flu.

    Day 5 trouble breathing

    Seven days to go to hospital. 

    Some will recover after 7 days.

    Others will go to the hospital

    If you go to the hospital you will probably have Pneumonia.

    Stay home when you are sick.
