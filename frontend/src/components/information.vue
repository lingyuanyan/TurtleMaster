     <h3>How to avoid Infection</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Avoid touching any surface when outside.</li>
       <li>Limit outside activity.</li>
       <li>Wear a mask whenever you go outside or when you are going to be around infected people.</li>
       <li>Try to social distance with as many people as possible. (6ft away ,2 yards. 1.8288 meters)</li>
       <li>stay away from large groups of people and minimize the amount of time you are spending outside.</li>
       <li>WASH YOUR HANDS using soap and water, or hand sanitizer.</li>
       <li>Travel as little as possible.</li>
       <li>Wear a facemask as they are proven to help reduce the amount of infected air particles when you cough or sneeze.</li>
       <li>Studies show that air conditioning can circulate covid particles if someone sitting in the air circulation area has covid they can spread covid to you through the air.</li>
       <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, going to the bathroom, before eating or when preparing food.</li>
       <li>Avoid touching your face to stop the Covid particles from reaching your face.</li>
       <li>Use 2 layers of cotton face masks because it is the most effective.</li>
       <li>cover your mouth or nose whenever you sneeze or cough.</li>
       <li>avid touching surfaces outside.</li>
       <li>clean everything as many times as possible to keep germs from sticking onto them</li>
     </ul>
       <h3>Note that...</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>When indoors and eating avoid sitting next to the air conditioning as this will keep the Covid in the air.</li>
        <li>To when know that the pandemic is mostly over is when the infection can no longer be spread not when a vaccine comes out.</li>
        <li>The other health way for a pandemic to end is when most people die from it and other people that don't die have immunity hopefully this is not the way Covid ends.</li>
        <li>Covid could also "end" with people getting sick of staying home and going outside because there got tired of quarintine. </li>
      </ul>



    <h3>Isolate yourself if you have done these things with someone who has covid in the last 3 months</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Isolate yourself were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more.</li>
    <li>Isolate yourself provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19</li>
    <li>Isolate yourself had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them)</li>
    <li>Isolate yourself shared eating or drinking utensils</li>
    <li>Isolate yourself sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you</li>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8r3oTVMtQ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8r3oTVMtQ0</a>




     What is better soap or hand santizer. In general soap is better. This is because they keep the cell completely apart

     disinfect you and objects

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KKkElpyKQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7KKkElpyKQ</a>

     soap is better because it also gets rid of dirt that could be hiding

    When on the go use hand sanitizer for a long as possible rubbing it over the whole hand.

    When using soap and water also cover your whole hand. Do both for about 20 seconds.

    When using hand sanitizer use it until your hand are dry.
    While Soap and Water can get rid of all dirt that might hide viruses it is not as effective against other viruses called Rhinoviruses that don't have as many weak points that the soap and take advantage of while the Hand sanatizer will still work in destabilizing the virus. So when possibel use sanitizer and then use soap and water to get rid of dirt.
    <h3>What happens after you have been infected.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>First day feels like the flu.</li>
      <li>Day 5 trouble breathing</li>
      <li>After seven days to go to hospital.</li>
      <li>Some people will recover after 7 days.</li>
      <li>Others will go to the hospital</li>
      <li>If you go to the hospital you will probably have Pneumonia.</li>
      <li>Days 12-14 if people die this is most times. </li>
      <li>Day 18 is when most at risk patients die. </li>
      <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>As vaccines grow closer to public use and mass public use be ready to be vaccinated and also relizing that vaccination may lead to side effects like flu like symptoms. You should note that this is normal and does not mean that you are getting covid. </li>
    </ul>
